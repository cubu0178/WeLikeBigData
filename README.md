## DESCRIPTION:  
We strive to analyze and examine, in detail, the various event trends and reactionary data of human society. This data is being obtained from the GDELT project, in which our data archives a span of 45 years of “emotional snapshots”. This data is essentially known to be a study of the global human society. The attributes within our dataset, include information regarding societal influencers (people), risk assessment & global trends, policy reactions, and humanitarian & crisis responses. 

## QUESTIONS SOUGHT AND ANSWERS:  
- a) Was the breakup of the Soviet Union preceded by increased cooperation or conflict with other nations? How did the breakup        affect US-Russian relations and relations with other nations?
- b) Do the Olympics have any effect on global cooperation? Specifically, does the host nation of the Olympics have more              cooperation with other nations?
- c) Is there any connection between flare-ups of the conflict in Israel and Palestine and other global events of either conflict or        cooperation?
- d) Which country traditionally considered at-odds with the United States (eg. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran) shows the most            conflict over time, and is this level of conflict affected by changes in presidential administration?
