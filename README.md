 ## DESCRIPTION:  
We strive to analyze and examine, in detail, the various event trends and reactionary data of human society. This data is being obtained from the GDELT project, in which our data archives a span of 45 years of “emotional snapshots”. This data is essentially known to be a study of the global human society. The attributes within our dataset, include information regarding societal influencers (people), risk assessment & global trends, policy reactions, and humanitarian & crisis responses.
