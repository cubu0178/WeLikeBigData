## DESCRIPTION:  
We strive to analyze and examine, in detail, the various event trends and reactionary data of human society. This data is being obtained from the GDELT project, in which our data archives a span of 45 years of “emotional snapshots”. This data is essentially known to be a study of the global human society. The attributes within our dataset, include information regarding societal influencers (people), risk assessment & global trends, policy reactions, and humanitarian & crisis responses. 

## QUESTIONS SOUGHT AND ANSWERS:  
- a) Was the breakup of the Soviet Union preceded by increased cooperation or conflict with other nations? How did the breakup        affect US-Russian relations and relations with other nations?

-The years prior to the collapse in the Soviet Union were marked by an increase in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the rest of the world. Both incoming and outgoing events were at a higher level before the collapse of the Soviet Union than after. This seems to signify that the fall signaled an end of the cooperation of one of the world's largest superpowers, and the beginning of a race for dominance.

- b) Do the Olympics have any effect on global cooperation? Specifically, does the host nation of the Olympics have more              cooperation with other nations?

-Generally, the Olympics have a negative effect on the amount of verbal cooperation between a host nation and the rest of the world. After the Olympics are held in a country, the country averages a 1.7% decrease in verbal cooperation, and a 1.2% increase in verbal conflict. These results surprised us, as we believed the Olympics would help to bring nations into the fold on a global scale, and help bring nations together.

- c) How have the world's most threatening nations evolved over time?

## APPLICATION:  
Our analysis sought to find correlations between global events and the amount of cooperation or conflict between nations and regions. By asking these questions and analyzing the results, one might be able to predict when and where conflicts arise to avoid them, or show that increasing cooperation among nations helps to alleviate the amount of negative events that occur around the world.

Generally, this knowledge is only of value when placed in the hands of global leaders and influencers. For example, knowing that a conflict is about to occur between the United States and Russia is of little value unless one is in a position to alter the outcome of such a conflict or prevent it altogether. Furthermore, our main questions aimed to analyze the effects of communism and instability on the relationships between two nations. If one can definitively prove that Soviet Russia was beholden to more conflicts when it was a communist nation, and more positive events when it was not, this could serve as a warning to other communist nations around the world.

In the case of the break-up of the Soviet Union, one can analyze whether or not, prior to the break-up, there was an increase in conflict with other nations, or whether there was an increase in cooperation. This could serve as a guidebook for how to deal with rogue states; one can either pressure / threaten them into submission, or try to work together and find common ground. Either way, the information can be valuable when analyzing the rise and fall of similar nations today.
